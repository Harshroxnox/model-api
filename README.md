# Model-API
This is our machine learning model exposed as an API using fastapi. This api code is written in python and is currently deployed using aws EC2 instance. 
The public url where this API is hosted is: http://52.66.196.169.
- Note: This url cannot be accessed through browsers because you have to do a post request and attach json data to the body with proper format.
- Browsers can only do HTTP Get requests not HTTP Post requests. The recommended way is to download and install a software like postman on your system.
